IndexDB=>

    - Data base inside your browser (NoSQL)
    - we donot need to create IndexDB but it already exist in the browser. 

    SQL => relational Database (Tables & unko relate karta hai using primary key & )


    NoSQL => we donot need tables, don't need relation just need objects (JS ka object chahia).

    - Instead of creating tables, create a collection of objects with SIMILAR KIND OF DATA

        - repersent students data & there is no format in which data must be stored
        - these object are typing to store similar kind of data 

        (You can create multiple collections, we cannot create relations) 
        these are trying defining category as STUDENTS TABLES
        collection = [
            {Name: Aniruth, Roll Number: 1, Collage: DU},
            {Name: Ram, Collage: DU, Address: Delhi }
            {}
            {} (empty object daldia par yaa bhi valid hai, koi hard & fast rule nahi hai ki koi value honi chahia iss object mai)
            {}
            {Name: charan}
            {}
        ]
        - A single object is trying to repersent one student information.
        - A single NoSQL DB can contain mutiple objects(collections) of data & in IndexDB we call these collections objectStore. 
        - If you want to create an "objectstore" you can only do that in 'upgradeneeded' event function.
        - objectStore is called collections.  


    Students Table (You create multiple tables, tables can be related)

    (all rows data is of similar type)
    Name        Collage Name     Address
    Anirudh      GTBIT             Delhi   (single row single data koo repersent kar kahi hai)
    Ram            DU              Delhi



    Q LocalStorage sort of Database joki browser store karta hai and IndexDB also does the same ? So What is the difference ?

    LocalStorage => 

    - LocalStorage KEY VALUE PAIR use karte the (objects were not stored)
    - It is used to store only strings.( hum JSON.stringfy karta tha then data store kar pata tha in LocalStorage).
    - Directly object store => any kind of data store kr sakta hai. 
    - LocalStorage max 5mb data can be stored.

    IndexDB => 

    - In IndexDB, we donot have KEY VALUE PAIR, we Directly store object in => any kind of data store kar sarkta hai.
    - IndexedDB has no such limit (2gb-3gb) In a sense secondary storage (they are persistant). Data is not stored in RAM because RAM is volatile.
